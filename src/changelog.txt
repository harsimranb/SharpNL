 - via NuGet

2014-12-08 Knuppe
 * Stemmers began to be rewritten ( the compiler freaks with the automatically generated by Snowball, problems like:
   heuristically unreachable, unused variables, etc... So I'll rewrite a decent stemmer... )

2014-12-09 Knuppe 
 * I decided to expose the extensions (SharpNL.Extesions) since they are quite userful.
 * The AbstractStemmer was added with cache support, surely the cache will improve performance.
 * English and Portuguese Porter's stemming algorithm were implemented... And they are thread-safe now! :D
 * RSLP (Stemming Algorithm for the Portuguese Language) implemented.
